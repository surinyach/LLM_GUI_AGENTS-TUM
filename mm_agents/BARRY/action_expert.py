# PROMPTS

PROMPT = """
You are an expert agent for the OSWorld environment. Your sole purpose is to translate a given instruction into a precise PyAutoGUI command.

### Task
You will be provided with an instruction, a screenshot and feedback if you failed previously solving the instruction. Your task is to generate the single, exact PyAutoGUI command that accomplishes the instruction.

### Instruction
{instruction}

### Feedback
{feedback}

### Rules
1.  **Analyze screen state**: Use the screenshot to understand the current GUI state.
2.  **Determine next action**: Identify the correct PyAutoGUI command for the instruction.
3.  **Output format**: Respond with **only** a single line of valid PyAutoGUI code.  All coordinates in the output must be in pixels (integers).
4.  **Constraints**: Do not include any extra text, explanations, comments, or code imports.
5.  **Format**: Important! Do not enclose the response in backticks or any other formatting.

### Supported PyAutoGUI Actions
* `pyautogui.click(x, y)`
* `pyautogui.doubleClick(x, y)`
* `pyautogui.rightClick(x, y)`
* `pyautogui.drag(x1, y1, x2, y2)`
* `pyautogui.typewrite('text')`
* `pyautogui.press('key')`
* `pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'c')`
* `pyautogui.scroll(clicks)`
* `time.sleep(seconds)`

This is what I need to do: "{instruction}" 
and this is my screen right now. What should I do?
"""

PROMPT_STEP_2 = """
This is the set of mark of my screen. For each element related with the instruction tell me:
1. The number of the box they are encapsulated in
2. What is this element.
3. What is its function.


REMEMBER!
The numbers of the boxes are random!!! so it is very unlikely that the chosen boxes are in order.

the sliders are not encapusalated in a whole box, only its interactable element. This interactable element usually has a wrong description

Select at least 5 elements that are close and could be raltionated with the instruction topic so you can examine them and compare them later.
"""

PROMPT_STEP_3 = """
Now i'm going to pass you the description of the set of mark of the screen that i just passed you in the previous message. 
I want you to look at the numbers you have chosen and reflect about if you got them right, If you looked at the wrong element, and if not, which number could be the right ones. 
Probably if the numbers are in order they are plrobably wrong because the numbers are random.
You could think about if the numbers are right or you should have gotten other elements taking into account the description or the coordinates of its boxes. 
For example is there is an element with a box slightly to the left of the element you chose anad its description is brightness maybe you choose the brightness slider instead of the volume slider.

{SOM_description}

"""

PROMPT_STEP_4 = """
now, taking into account that this is the resolution of the screen: {width}x{height} 
Give me te coordenates of the center of the box I have to click.
"""

PROMPT_STEP_5 = """
Now give me the command (or the set of commands) in pyAutoGUI to perform the instruction with the coordinates of the last message.

Supported pyautogui actions:
* pyautogui.click(x, y)
* pyautogui.doubleClick(x, y)
* pyautogui.rightClick(x, y)

* Dragging:
- You will need two instructions to drag:
* pyautogui.moveTo(x1,y1) (starting position)
* pyautogui.dragTo(x2, y2, duration=duration, button=button) (ending position)

* pyautogui.typewrite('text')
* pyautogui.press('key')
* pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'c')
* pyautogui.scroll(clicks)
* time.sleep(seconds)

The response MUST start with the exact phrase "RESPONSE:" on its own line, followed immediately by the response.
If there is more than one command it should be separated only by a ';'. 

Always add time.sleep(1) at the end of the commands

Example of how the response should appear:
RESPONSE: pyautogui.click(x, y);pyautogui.typewrite('text');time.sleep(1)
